                <h2>BODY</h2>
                <p>Abyssinians possess sleek, slender bodies with developed musculature. Overall, there is a look of athleticism and poise. The average weight for the male Abyssinian is 7 to 12 pounds; that for the female is slightly less, at 6 to 9 pounds.</p>
                <h2>HEAD</h2>
                <p>The head of the Abyssinian cat is a modified wedge, with minimal rounding along the brow, cheek, and profile. Cheekbone shading, shadowing, and dots on the whisker pads are typical. The muzzle is even, not square or pointed. Entire adult males will have jowls.</p>
                <h2>EYES</h2>
                <p>Abyssinians have gold, copper, green or hazel eyes, accompanied by dark lines that run from the eyes and eyebrows. Abyssinian eyes are large, expressive, and almond-shaped and are responsible for this breed's exotic look. Darker skin on the eyelids surrounds the outer rim of the eyes and is edged with a lighter colored zone.</p>
                <h2>EARS</h2>
                <p>An Abyssinian cat's ears are large, wide-set, moderately pointed, and cupped at the base.</p>

                <h2>LEGS & PAWS</h2>
                <p>The legs of the Abyssinian cat are long, slim, and muscular. The oval paws are relatively small and appear to almost give the effect of the cat being on tiptoes.</p>
                <h2>TAIL</h2>
                <p>Abyssinian cats have long tails that are thickest at the base and taper to a point at the end.</p>
                <h2>COAT</h2>
                <p>The Abyssinian has a brief coat that is fine and silky in texture. The agouti pattern, the typical tabby ticked coat, has each individual hair banded with alternating darker and lighter colorings with up to four to six bands of ticking. On all Abyssinian cat colors, the hair tips are darkest, and usually exhibit faint patterning.</p>
                <h2>COLOR</h2>
                <p>The CFA breed standard provides four recognized Abyssinian cat coat colors: ruddy, cinnamon, blue, and fawn. Separate nose leather and paw pad color are associated with each coat color. The TICA breed standard defines six traditional colors (ruddy, cinnamon, chocolate, blue, fawn, and lilac) and six colors in the silver division: black-silver, cinnamon-silver, chocolate-silver, and diluted blue-silver, fawn-silver, and lilac-silver.</p>
