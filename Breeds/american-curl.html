        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>The American Curl cat is named for its distinctive ears that curl backward, creating a unique shell-like shape. Unlike the Scottish Fold, which is entirely different genetically, the American Curl is known for its engaging personality. These sociable cats love to greet their families and often follow them around the house. They are great with children and get along well with other pets. Available in a wide range of colors and patterns, American Curls come in both long and short hair varieties. Their silky topcoats and minimal undercoats make them delightful to cuddle. In addition to their eye-catching ears, they also have long, luxurious tails. While many with highly curled ears are kept as show cats, those with subtler curls are often cherished pets, making the American Curl an excellent companion.</p>

    <div id="Nutrition" class="content">
        <p>American Curl cats do not have special nutritional needs. We recommend you feed them a high-quality, meat-based diet. They are very sweet and friendly, but they still need to eat meat!</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content">
        <p>American Curl cats groom themselves well, just like other cats. Brush them lightly a few times a week, trim their nails regularly, and clean their ears when needed.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Exercise" class="content">
        <p>American Curl cats are playful and enjoy games with their families. They like to play fetch and can learn to carry small balls and toys. These cats love to climb and need to scratch, so provide a cat tree, a window perch, and toys. Since they want to be with you, start playtime to keep them from lounging on the couch too long. It will be fun for both of you!</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Health" class="content">
        <p>American Curl cats need special ear care. The lower ear cartilage is stiff, but the upper part is thin and fragile. Use a light touch and a gentle cleaning solution. Watch for signs of ear infections. Generally, American Curl cats are healthy and live around 15 years.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>All American Curl cats descend from a stray black cat named Shulamith, who was adopted by a family in Lakewood, California, in 1981. Her kittens, born six months later, had curled ears. Selective breeding started in 1983, revealing that the curled ear gene is autosomal dominant. Any cat with this gene will have curled ears. Feline geneticist Roy Robinson found no defects in early breeding. The American Curl is valued for its good health, unique look, and friendly personality.</p>

        <h1>Did You Know?</h1>
        <p>American curls are nicknamed the "Peter Pan of cats" thanks to their tendency to retain kittenish behaviors throughout their lives.</p>
        <p>American curl kittens are born with straight ears. The ears begin to curl back at about 3 to 5 days of age. They remain curled for several weeks and they don't completely unfurl into their final shape until the kitten reaches about 16 weeks of age.</p>

They are moderately large and evenly placed on the sides and top of the head, with desirable ear furnishings adding charm.</p><br>
            <h2>LEGS & PAWS</h2><br>
            <p>The legs should be of medium length, with medium boning. The feet should have a rounded shape and should be of medium size.</p><br>
            <h2>TAIL</h2><br>
            <p>The American curl's tail should be the same length as its body. It should be wide at the base with a tapering shape.</p><br>
            <h2>COAT</h2><br>
            <p>American curl cats may have long or short coats.</p><br>
