        <p>Friendly, intelligent, and playful, Havana Brown cats are wonderful all-around pets for families of all types. They love children and are capable of making long-term friends out of other pets. All these wonderful qualities have led to the Havana Brown being nicknamed "Chocolate Delight."

        <p>If you are looking for a devoted pet, you may want to look at a Havana! These cats shatter feline stereotypes that include aloof, independent natures; in fact, The Havana Brown is a charmer, living on human attention. These babies are not content without their beloved humans by their sides.</p>

    <div id="Nutrition" class="content"> 
        <h3>Nutrition</h3> 
        <p>Havana Brown cats have no special nutritional needs. At the same time, it is vital to provide a high-quality diet to support well-being. If you are not feeding fresh food, ensure that real meat or fish is the number one ingredient in the commercial diet you choose.</p> 
    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content"> 
        <h3>Grooming</h3> 
        <p>Thanks to their short coats, Havana Brown cats require no intensive grooming. You can keep your cat looking their best by removing loose hair with a soft brush once or twice per week. You might also want to polish your cat's coat with a chamois or silk scarf after brushing. This will really bring out the shine!</p> 
        <p>You can help your cat stay healthy by teaching them to allow you to brush their teeth. Last but not least, you might consider keeping their nails trimmed. Your furniture and clothing will thank you.</p> 
    </div>
    <div id="Exercise" class="content"> 
        <h3>Exercise</h3> 
        <p>Havana Brown cats are very playful by nature. Not only do they like to show off their athletics by acrobatic leaps and high jumps, they appreciate games of fetch and might even bring you a favorite toy to encourage you to join in on the fun.</p> 
        <p>Treat your cat to plenty of toys and be sure that they have items to keep them engaged when you can't be there to play. Puzzle games, a tall cat tree, multiple scratching posts, and a window seat with a view of a birdfeeder are some of the things that will help keep your Havana Brown cat entertained so they are less likely to get into trouble while you're away.</p> 
    </div>
    <div id="Health" class="content"> 
        <h3>Health</h3> 
        <p>Havana Brown cats are generally healthy, but those familiar with the breed have identified some issues that tend to occur at a higher than average rate.</p> 
        <p>Some Havana Brown kittens are born with hemophilia, which prevents blood from clotting properly. This isn't terribly common however it does underscore the importance of choosing a reputable breeder.</p> 
        <p>Upper respiratory infections and urinary tract problems can occur in any cat but some Havana's appear to be slightly more susceptible to these issues than others. Your veterinarian will be able to guide you on treatment if your pet develops these or any other illness.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>Although the solid brown cats are spoken of in the Tamra Maew Cat-Book Poems, an old text dating as far back as 1350 c.e. when Siam was established, the Havana Brown cat we are familiar with is quite a modern breed. Those very first old brown cats were not only handsome companions, they were said to have the ability to ward off evil. Since they were thought to be of such immense worth, a few self brown cats were imported to England from Siam in the late 19th century. They were said to be "Siamese, with coats of burnished chestnut, and greeny-blue eyes."</p>
            <p>Not all of these early imports were genetically identical to today's Havana Brown cats. Instead, they were probably Burmese, Tonkinese, and chocolate point Siamese. Some may have been the result of pairings between Siamese and domestic black or blue cats, resulting in cats that were similar to contemporary Havana Browns.</p>
            <p>Records show that solid brown cats were shown in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1888, a brown cat was awarded first prize at an English show, providing more evidence that the cat fanciers of the era appreciated these stunning chocolate colored cats as much as we do today.</p>
