            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The California Spangled cat breed was intentionally bred to resemble a leopard. The breed was created by crossing several breeds, including Abyssinian, Siamese, American Shorthair, British Shorthair, Angora cats, Manx, and moggies from Malaya and Egypt. The breed was perfected in 1985 and introduced to the public in 1986 when they graced the cover of the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog.</p>
