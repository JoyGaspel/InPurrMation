        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>The American longhair is not a specific cat breed, although aficionados are encouraging cat fancy associations to recognize this unique feline. For now, the term American longhair is used to indicate a cross between a Persian cat and an American shorthair cat.</p>
        <p>American longhair cats are typically medium-sized, reflecting the size and weight of their parents. Their coats come in a variety of colors and patterns and in varying degrees of thickness. There is sometimes confusion concerning the American longhair cat vs the Maine coon cat. This stems from the description of the Maine coon as America's original longhair cat.</p>

    <div id="Nutrition" class="content">
        <p>American longhair cats have no special nutritional needs. Their only requirement is a high quality meat-based diet.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content">
        <p>Like their Persian parent, the American longhair cat often has a very fine undercoat that requires frequent brushing to prevent mats from forming, and to prevent hairballs. Regular ear cleaning might be necessary, and you will probably want to clip your cats claws, too.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Exercise" class="content">
        <p>American longhair cats are playful, but less active than high-energy breeds such as the Abyssinian. These cats need scratching posts and toys, and they will almost certainly appreciate window seats and cat trees.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Health" class="content">
        <p>The average American longhair cat is a healthy, robust individual without any specific health problems. Since these cats are of mixed heritage, they tend to display the best of both breeds.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The first American longhair was the result of a breeding between a Persian cat and an American shorthair cat, with the intention of infusing the offspring with the brilliant silver color of the Persian.</p>
            <p>The resulting cats, now known as American longhair cats, had pleasant but not clingy personalities and soft coats in different colors.</p>
            <p>All American longhair cats have pedigreed parents; each can be traced back to a Persian parent and an American shorthair parent. Some cat fancier associations allow American longhair cats to be registered, however larger organizations do not yet recognize the American longhair as a distinct breed.</p>

        <h1>Did You Know?</h1>
        <p>American longhair cats are generally friendly toward other animals, with a noted preference for horses and friendly dogs. This doesn't mean they won't hunt smaller animals; in fact, their hunting instinct is quite good. Small pets, fish, and birds should be kept secure if they share a household with an American longhair cat.</p>
        <p>Although the American longhair cat has a friendly, mellow personality with adults and older children, they are often frightened of younger children and will make themselves scarce when young kids are present.</p>
