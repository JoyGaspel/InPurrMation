            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The Chausie is a hybrid breed that originated by breeding individuals from the non-domestic species jungle cat (Felis chaus) with domestic cats (Felis catus). The breed developed naturally among ancient Egyptians and along the rivers of Southeast Asia, with a modern breeding project beginning in the US in the 1990s. The Chausie was first recognized as a domestic breed by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1995.</p>
