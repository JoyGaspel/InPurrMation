            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The Oregon Rex cat breed originated in the United States, with the first documented case of a kitten with short, curly fur born in Oregon in 1955. The breed experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s but eventually waned. Breeders lost interest, and the last known purebred Oregon Rex cat is believed to have died in 1972, leading to the breed's extinction.</p><br>
