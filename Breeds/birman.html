        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>Birmans are affectionate, gentle, and sociable cats that enjoy being around their human families. They are typically calm, but they still enjoy playful interactions and may even ‚Äútalk‚Äù to you with their soft, sweet voices. Birmans tend to bond closely with their owners and are known to be good with children and other pets, including dogs.</p>

    <div id="Nutrition" class="content">
        <p>Birmans do well on a high-protein diet to support their muscular build. Fresh, meat-based food should be the first ingredient in their food. It‚Äôs also important to ensure that their food contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids for healthy skin and coat.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content">
        <p>Birmans have a semi-long, silky coat that doesn‚Äôt mat easily but still benefits from regular grooming. Brushing once a week will help prevent tangles and remove loose hairs. They also need regular dental care, nail trimming, and ear cleaning.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Exercise" class="content">
        <p>While Birmans are generally relaxed and don‚Äôt require extensive exercise, they are playful and enjoy interactive play. It‚Äôs important to provide them with plenty of toys and climbing opportunities to keep them mentally stimulated.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Health" class="content">
        <p>Birmans are generally healthy cats, but they can be prone to certain conditions, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a form of heart disease. Regular vet visits are essential to ensure early detection and treatment of any health issues.
