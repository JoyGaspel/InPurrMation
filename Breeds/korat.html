        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>The Korat cat is regarded as a living good luck charm in its native Thailand, and its gorgeous blue-gray hair is just the beginning. Whether you're looking for good fortune or just want to add a loving, smart cat to your home, the Korat can be the ideal companion! Since this is one of the rarest cat breeds, you will be extremely lucky to find the ideal Korat kitten to spoil.</p>
        <p>Siamese and Korat cats are closely related, and they both have some of the same charming personality traits. The Korat cat will be there to lend a helping hand and offer advice whether you're preparing lunch, cleaning up after dinner, folding laundry, or watching your favorite show. These cats love attention and love to be involved in every part of household management.</p>
        <p>The Korat, who is a bit more reserved than the Siamese, may meow in greeting or tap persistently if you aren't paying enough attention.</p>

    <div id="Nutrition" class="content">
        <p>Although Korat cats don't have any particular dietary requirements, they do well on a diet high in protein and low in added carbohydrates. When the mainstay of their diet is high-quality chow that has real meat or real fish as the primary ingredient, these cats look and feel their best. Think about giving your cat a new diet if you can.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content">
        <p>Korat cats have short, easy-care fur that doesn't take much attention from their human companions. To minimize shedding and remove loose hair, try brushing your cat once a week. Then, use a silk scarf or chamois to quickly polish their magnificent gray coat to bring out the sheen.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Exercise" class="content">
        <p>Think of your house as the Korat's own playground! These cats love to run, jump, and climb. Tall cat trees, scratching posts, and plenty of toys can spare your favorite possessions from damage while giving your cat with safe, socially acceptable means to meet their physical activity needs.</p>
        <p>Korat cats like interaction from their human and animal mates. For those occasions when you are not present to play fetch or dangle a feather wand for your kitten, consider food puzzles and other intriguing toys. These clever cats will soon find ways to entertain themselves without the proper mental stimulation, breaking into cabinets and drawers and playing with your possessions.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Health" class="content">
        <p>Although Korat cats are normally healthy, they can occasionally be born with gangliosidosis, a deadly genetic disorder that impairs normal cellular function and eventually damages the central nervous system. By around three months of age, cats with GM1 gangliosidosis exhibit neurologic symptoms such as convulsions and blurred eyesight, and they are unlikely to live past their first year.</p>
        <p>Korat cats with GM2 gangliosidosis generally show neurologic indications at an age as early as four weeks, and typically do not survive past the age of eight months.</p>
        <p>Reputable Korat breeders can screen parents, which significantly lowers the chance that children would have this horrible hereditary condition.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>Native to Phimai, Thailand, Korat cats get its name from the Nakhon Ratchasima province, which Thai people refer to as Korat. It's interesting to note that the Korat cat is referred to locally as Si Sawat, which means "The color of sawat seed." The Thai Tamra Maew, sometimes called The Cat-Book Poems, contains entries that date back to as early as 1350 CE.</p>
            <p>Korat cats were never sold; they were only ever given away as presents until recently. They were occasionally given to significant community members as a token of gratitude and respect. Eventually, Korat cats arrived in Britain, where they were referred to as Blue Siamese. These cats were occasionally displayed in Russian or "Any Other Blue" classes because they did not meet Siamese criteria. Mrs. B. Spearman, a cat breeder, fell much in love with these elegant cats and tried, but failed, to bring more of them to England.</p>
            <p>When a breeding pair was brought to the US by Cedar Glen Cattery in 1959, korat cats made a reappearance in the West. In 1966, the CFA awarded the Korat cat championship status, and breed registries all over the world now recognize these amazing cats.</p>

            <h2>BODY</h2><br>
            <p>The Korat has a semi-cobby body that is neither compact nor svelte. The cat should feel heavier than it looks due to its well-developed muscles.</p><br>
            <h2>HEAD</h2><br>
            <p>Korat cats have a distinctive heart-shaped head. The brow ridges form the heart's upper edges, while the sides of the face curve to the chin, completing the heart shape. When viewed from the side, the head should be well-defined, with a modest halt between the nose and forehead.</p><br>
            <h2>EYES</h2><br>
            <p>Eyes should be huge, round, and wide open, with a slight Asian slant when closed or half closed. Brilliant green is the desired eye color, but an Amber hue is okay. Final eye color develops between 2-4 years of age.</p><br>
            <h2>EARS</h2><br>
            <p>The ears should be big, with flared bases and rounded points. They should be positioned higher on the head. Furniture should be sparse.</p><br>
            <h2>LEGS & PAWS</h2><br>
            <p>The legs should have good proportions, with the front legs being somewhat shorter than the back legs. The paws should be oval-shaped.</p><br>
            <h2>TAIL</h2><br>
            <p>A Korat cat's tail should be medium-length, with a thicker base and a taper that finishes in a rounded tip.</p><br>
            <h2>COAT</h2><br>
            <p>The Korat cat has a single hair coat that lies close to its body. The hair should feel soft and silky.</p><br>
            <h2>COLOR</h2><br>
            <p>Korat cats should have silver-tipped blue coloration throughout, with enough silver at the tips to give a silver halo effect. The nose leather and lips should be lavender or dark blue.</p><br>
