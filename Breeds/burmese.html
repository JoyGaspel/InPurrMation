    <div id="Nutrition" class="content">
        <p>Burmese cats benefit from a high-protein, meat-based diet to support their active lifestyle. Fresh food with real meat listed as the primary ingredient is ideal. Keep an eye on portion sizes to prevent overeating, as they can be prone to obesity if overfed.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content">
        <p>Burmese cats have short, fine coats that require minimal grooming. A weekly brushing will help keep their coats in good condition and reduce shedding. Regular nail trimming, ear cleaning, and dental care should also be part of their grooming routine.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Exercise" class="content">
        <p>Burmese cats are highly energetic and need plenty of exercise to stay healthy and happy. Interactive play, climbing opportunities, and puzzle toys will help keep them physically and mentally stimulated. They also enjoy playing fetch and will often entertain themselves by retrieving toys.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Health" class="content">
        <p>Burmese cats are generally healthy, but they can be prone to certain health issues, such as respiratory problems due to their short noses, and some genetic conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Regular vet visits and a healthy diet are important for their overall well-being.

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The Burmese cat originated in Southeast Asia and was developed in the United States in the 1930s. The breed was created by crossing a Siamese cat with a solid brown cat, resulting in the unique chocolate-colored coat and affectionate nature that Burmese cats are known for today.</p><br>
