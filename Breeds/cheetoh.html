            <p>The Cheetoh cat is a newer hybrid breed created in the United States in 2001 by Carol Dryman. The breed was developed by crossing Bengal cats with Ocicats to create a new cat breed with a gentle, friendly nature and a physical appearance similar to a wildcat. Despite being a relatively new breed, the Cheetoh cat has gained popularity for its unique appearance and affectionate personality.</p><br>
