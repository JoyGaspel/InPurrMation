        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>Burmillas are affectionate, playful, and friendly cats that enjoy being around their human family. They are social cats, often seeking attention and enjoying time spent with their owners. Their gentle and sweet-natured personalities make them ideal pets for families and individuals alike. While they are playful and curious, they are not overly demanding and are quite content to relax with their owners.</p>

    <div id="Nutrition" class="content">
        <p>Burmillas thrive on a high-protein diet, and like all cats, they should have meat as the first ingredient in their food. A healthy balance of nutrients will help support their coat and overall health.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content">
        <p>The Burmilla‚Äôs short coat is relatively easy to maintain. Brushing once a week will help reduce shedding and keep the coat shiny. Regular dental care, ear cleaning, and nail trimming are also recommended.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Exercise" class="content">
        <p>Burmillas are playful and active, though they are not as high-energy as some other breeds. They enjoy interactive play and like to chase toys, but they can also be content lounging next to their family. Ensuring they have opportunities to climb and explore is important for their well-being.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Health" class="content">
        <p>The Burmilla is generally a healthy breed. However, like many breeds, they can be prone to certain conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and renal issues. Regular vet checkups and a healthy diet are important for their longevity.
