        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>Some cats despise being held, but the Ragdoll cat appears to thrive for cuddling. Whereas many cats are content to enjoy themselves, Ragdolls actively seek the company of their favorite people, following family members from one room to the next. Ragdolls are not particularly curious, but they like participating in daily life and frequently observe activities with amused looks on their adorable faces.</p>
        <p>These friendly cats want to be wherever you are, whether you're watching your favorite show on the couch or working on a project in the office or garage. Rather than knocking over your collectibles, the gentle Ragdoll will delicately maneuver around your sensitive belongings. Ragdolls are one of the few cat breeds who enjoy water, so they'll likely follow you to the shower or sit on the side of the bathtub, keeping you company and possibly getting their paws wet.</p>
        <p>Ragdolls provide more than just steadfast company. These beautiful cats live to make you happy, frequently repeating activities that generate positive reactions. Positive reinforcement can be used to teach a Ragdoll cat specific tricks and behavior.</p>

    <div id="Nutrition" class="content"> 
        <h3>Nutrition</h3> 
        <p>Ragdoll cats have no unique nutritional requirements, but quality is essential because these low-energy cats might gain weight if fed a low-quality diet. Provide a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet with real meat or fish as the primary element.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Grooming" class="content"> 
        <h3>Grooming</h3> 
        <p>Ragdoll cats, with their luscious double coats, require regular care. Most Ragdoll cats like daily brushing since it not only prevents mats, excess shedding, and hairballs, but it also allows them to bond with their favorite persons.</p> 
        <p>Teach your cat to tolerate toothbrushing from an early age, and clip your Ragdoll cat's nails every two to four weeks.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Exercise" class="content"> 
        <h3>Exercise</h3> 
        <p>Ragdoll cats enjoy napping and relaxing, but they also have a lively personality. Provide your cat with toys, scratching poles, and cat towers that allow them to see what you're doing.</p> 
        <p>Ragdoll cats behave like kittens until they achieve full maturity, which usually occurs between the ages of two and four years. After that, it may be up to you to initiate play sessions and urge your Ragdoll cat to participate in the exercise that is so important for good health and life.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Health" class="content"> 
        <h3>Health</h3> 
        <p>Ragdoll cats are generally healthy and live an average of 12 to 15 years. Ragdolls, like many pedigreed cats, are susceptible to certain genetic health issues. Some Ragdolls may be genetically predisposed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a type of cardiac disease. Ragdolls are also susceptible to polycystic kidney disease (PKD), bladder stones, and obesity.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The Ragdoll cat breed originated in Riverside, California, during the 1960s. Breeder Ann Baker had a lovely white domestic longhair cat named Josephine, who was known for giving birth to kittens with extremely sociable characteristics. As she worked to create the Ragdoll breed, Baker collected a range of longhair cats from various backgrounds, focusing on outstanding temperament, rich coats with Himalayan points, and huge stature.</p>
            <p>Persians, Burmese, and Birman cats are considered to have contributed to the development of the Ragdoll breed. Part of the reason for this is because Persians and Birmans are known for their laid-back attitudes.</p>
            <p>Josephine was the first cat to contribute to the Ragdoll line, but two others were Blackie (a full black cat with Burmese-like traits) and Daddy Warbucks. Josephine and Daddy Warbucks produced a bicolor girl daughter named Fugianna. Meanwhile, a litter born from a coupling of Blackie and Josephine produced a dark brown female with Burmese characteristics named Buckwheat. All following Ragdoll generations are descended from litters produced by Daddy Warbucks and Buckwheat, as well as Daddy Warbucks and Fugianna.</p>

        <h1>Did You Know?</h1>
        <p>Ragdoll cats get their name from their tendency to go completely limp and relaxed when picked up, much like a ragdoll.</p>
        <p>Ragdoll kittens are born completely white and develop their color points as they mature, with full coloration taking 2-4 years to develop completely.</p>

            <h2>BODY</h2><br>
            <p>The Ragdoll cat is medium to large in size and lacks dramatic traits. The body is broad, substantial, lengthy, and full, with a muscular build. A significant stomach pad may be found on the lower abdomen.</p><br>
            <h2>HEAD</h2><br>
            <p>The head is relatively large, with a broad, modified wedge shape that creates an equilateral triangle from the base of the ears to the end of the muzzle. The muzzle is softly rounded, and males may have jowls.</p><br>
            <h2>EYES</h2><br>
            <p>The eyes are huge and oval shaped. Purebred Ragdoll cats should have blue eyes.</p><br>
            <h2>EARS</h2><br>
            <p>The ears are medium-sized, with broad bases and rounded tips. Ample furniture may be present.</p><br>
            <h2>LEGS & PAWS</h2><br>
            <p>The legs are moderately long and strongly boned. The front legs typically have shorter fur, while the back legs have longer, fluffy britches.</p><br>
            <h2>TAIL</h2><br>
            <p>Ragdoll cats have a long, full tail with a beautiful plume.</p><br>
            <h2>COAT</h2><br>
            <p>Ragdoll cats' coats have considerably more non-matting guard hairs than wooly undercoats. The facial hair is short and there may be a ruff. The length of the coat may be shorter in warm weather than in cold.</p><br>
            <h2>COLOR</h2><br>
            <p>Ragdoll kittens are born white. Ragdoll cats reach full maturity between the ages of 2 and 4 years and exhibit a wide range of colors and patterns, including seal, chocolate, lilac, red, and blue, as well as tortoiseshell and lynx. Many bear subtle white markings on their faces and undersides. Mitted Ragdoll cats have white "snowshoe" feet and may have other white markings.</p><br>

        <h1>Did You Know?</h1>
        <p>Ragdolls are one of the largest domestic cat breeds, with males often weighing 15-20 pounds when fully grown.</p>
        <p>Unlike most cats, Ragdolls typically don't land on their feet when dropped due to their extremely relaxed nature.</p>
