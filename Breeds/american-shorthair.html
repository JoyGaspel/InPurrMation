        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>Friendly and easy to care for, the American Shorthair cat is similar to the Domestic Shorthair. The main difference is that American Shorthairs consistently share specific traits, while Domestic Shorthairs show various characteristics from different breeds. This can cause confusion, as the American Shorthair was once called the Domestic Shorthair, but they are now recognized as a distinct breed.</p>

        <p>American Shorthair cats have no special nutritional needs. Feed them a healthy, balanced diet of high-quality cat food.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content">
        <p>American Shorthair cats are easy to groom. Brush them with a soft or fine brush at least once a week to remove loose hair, keeping furniture cleaner and reducing hairballs.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Exercise" class="content">
        <p>American Shorthair cats are moderately active and prone to obesity without enough exercise. Provide toys and encourage play to prevent this. With a hunting background, they enjoy interactive toys and laser pointers. A cat tree can protect your drapes while giving them a cozy spot to relax and climb.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Health" class="content">
        <p>American Shorthair cats are generally healthy but can be prone to obesity. They may also face two other health issues: hereditary hip dysplasia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which can cause enlarged hearts. These problems affect only a small percentage of cats.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>When European colonizers arrived in America, they brought cats with them, which were the ancestors of the American Shorthair cat. As other breeds arrived, the American Shorthair became distinct with its own unique traits. The bloodline was strengthened with British Shorthair DNA, but American Shorthairs have rounder, softer bodies. They starred in the first U.S. cat show in 1895, and the first documented breeding of two American Shorthairs took place in 1904. Since then, this breed has remained one of the most popular in the United States.</p>

            <h2>BODY</h2><br>
            <p>The American Shorthair exudes power, confidence, and grace. They have muscular, compact bodies with a rounded shape that is both cuddly and cute.</p><br>
            <h2>HEAD</h2><br>
            <p>You can easily distinguish an American Shorthair from a domestic shorthair by its head shape. American Shorthairs have distinctly rounded heads with prominent cheeks and fleshy whisker pads. Many also have noticeable jowls, especially in intact males.</p><br>
            <h2>EYES</h2><br>
            <p>The American Shorthair has large, rounded eyes with half-almond shaped upper lids and distinctly rounded lower lids. There should be at least one eye width between the eyes, with the upper corners set slightly higher than the lower corners. Eye colors can range from gold to green, and blue eyes or two different colored eyes are also acceptable.</p><br>
            <h2>EARS</h2><br>
            <p>An American Shorthair cat has medium-sized ears with rounded tips. The ears are set wide apart on the head and are not overly large at the base.</p><br>
            <h2>LEGS & PAWS</h2><br>
            <p>The American Shorthair cat has strong, stocky legs that may seem shorter and less elegant than those of other breeds. Its paws are strong, round, and somewhat wide. The color of the paw pads usually matches the nose leather color, with various shades depending on the cat's overall color and pattern.</p><br>
            <h2>TAIL</h2><br>
            <p>American Shorthair cats have long, proportional tails that are slightly wider at the base and taper toward the end. They typically carry their tails level or at a slight upward angle.</p><br>
            <h2>COAT</h2><br>
            <p>The American Shorthair breed has a short, lustrous coat that is full-bodied and has an even texture. The coat should look soft and healthy.</p><br>
            <h2>COLOR</h2><br>
            <p>American Shorthair cats come in every color and pattern except for the pointed patterns found in Asian breeds like the Siamese. Acceptable colors and patterns include tabby, tortoiseshell, smoke, blue, white, and black. Overall, the breed standard recognizes more than 80 colors and patterns for American Shorthairs.</p><br>
