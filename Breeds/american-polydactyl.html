        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>Also referred to as Hemingway cats in tribute to the cats that roam Ernest Hemingway's Florida estate, most American polydactyl cats are born with one or more extra toes on each front paw. A few polydactyl cats also have extra toes on their hind paws. A very few have extra toes on their hind paws but not on their front paws.</p>
        <p>Though the American polydactyl cat is not legally listed by the Cat Fanciers Association of America, and though it is not a breed of cat, it is loved for its adorable, whimsical look. The additional toes on the front paws of a polydactyl cat adds to the appearance that the cat has mittens on or maybe even opposable thumbs. Some polydactyl cats possess so many extra toes that their paws double the size of a typical cat's paws.</p>
        <p>Certain cat fancier clubs accept all polydactyl cats. They are exhibited under the common term "American polydactyl cat." This sometimes causes confusion, leading people to believe that American polydactyl cats are a different breed.</p>
        <p>The truth is that polydactyl cats can belong to any breed, and they can be of any color. The only aspect that distinguishes a polydactyl cat from others is the extra toes, which are brought about by a genetic mutation.</p>

    <div id="Nutrition" class="content"> 
        <h3>Nutrition</h3> 
        <p>Polydactyl cats do not have unique dietary requirements. They need the same meat diet consumed by all other domestic cats. We suggest you feed your polydactyl cat a diet comprising of good-quality cat food.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Grooming" class="content"> 
        <h3>Grooming</h3> 
        <p>Just as with any other cat, regular grooming will suit American polydactyl cats. Your cat's hair coat will dictate what kind of grooming is necessary. Short-haired cats should be brushed or combed once weekly merely to take away loose hair and reduce shedding, whereas long-haired cats may thrive on brushing and combing each day.</p> 
        <p>You need to also train your cat to tolerate nail trimming from an early age. Trimming a polydactyl cat's claws is especially necessary because, at times, their claws will grow in strange directions, and cause them discomfort, get caught on things, and be a general annoyance. Trimming your cat's nails will save your furniture and your skin as well!</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Exercise" class="content"> 
        <h3>Exercise</h3> 
        <p>Regular exercise is good for American polydactyl cats. Maintaining your cat's healthy weight will help minimize the extra stress put on their feet and joints, keeping them comfortable as they age.</p> 
        <p>We suggest rewarding your cat with a climbing and perching tower as well as a variety of toys such as something they can play alone with and interactive items like laser toys and wands that involve you in the play.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Health" class="content"> 
        <h3>Health</h3> 
        <p>Polydactyl cats do not have any concerning health issues although certain toes do have ingrown claws when they are not trimmed. When extra digits are composed of soft tissue alone, in some instances, they may be vulnerable to injury; this is so when extra toes are not well joined to other parts of the cat's skeletal system.</p> 
        <p>Some polydactyl cats do have deformities that are present at birth, including fused toes that can be painful. Since each individual is unique, the best approach is to have your vet take a look at your polydactyl cat‚Äôs feet and determine whether any problems might occur. If so, they can suggest treatment to help your cat live comfortably.</p> 
        <p>The typical polydactyl cat spends a long, healthy lifetime much the same as other cats in its breed.</p> 
        <p>There is also another health condition that looks somewhat like polydactyly. Feline radial hypoplasia results in additional toes growing on a cat's paws. But they grow in addition to the cat's normal toes, making the paws very large and very flat. Though this condition may not be painful, it does result in severe deformity of the feet in future generations when breeding cats with feline radial hypoplasia.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>Although the American polydactyl cat is not a particular breed, they do have one very special gene. Polydactyly results from a dominant gene which, in other mammals, produces hyperdactyly (added toes or fingers) ‚Äì humans can carry it too!</p>
            <p>There are varying forms of polydactyly in cats:</p>
            <p>Preaxial polydactyly results in additional digits on the medial side of the paw, making the cat look like it's wearing mittens.</p>
            <p>Postaxial polydactyly results in additional digits on the lateral aspect of the paw and receives nicknames such as snowshoe cat, patty paws, or pancake paws.</p>
            <p>Note that Pixie Bob and Maine Coon polydactyl cats are their own categories. Once, a whopping 40% of all Maine Coon cats sported extra toes and it's still fairly prevalent for these babies to show the polydactyl trait. Some Maine Coon breeders even breed for it, as the Maine Coon Polydactyl is accepted by The International Cat Association (TICA) and some smaller cat fanciers clubs.</p>
            <p>Polydactyl Pixie Bob cats are so prevalent that they are allowed to be exhibited and registered, provided that they possess no more than seven toes on each foot.</p>
            <p>At present, these are the only polydactyl cat "breeds" that can be exhibited. Other breed standards exclude polydactyl cats, stating that they cannot be registered or exhibited, even if they only possess a single additional toe.</p>

        <h1>Did You Know?</h1>
        <p>Ernest Hemingway's home in Key West, Florida is where about 50 descendants of his polydactyl cat, Snow White, live. About half of the cats at Hemingway's home have extra toes, but all possess the gene that results in cats having extra toes. It's a polydactyl heaven!</p>
        <p>Polydactyl cats were thought to be lucky by sailors. Their big paws made it easy for them to stay on their feet when water got choppy and polydactyl cats are generally great mousers, catching many more mice than your average cat.</p>
