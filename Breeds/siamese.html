        <h3>Nutrition</h3> 
        <p>Siamese cats thrive on a high-protein, meat-based diet. It's important to feed them a balanced diet with all the necessary nutrients, including omega fatty acids for healthy skin and coat.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Grooming" class="content"> 
        <h3>Grooming</h3>

    </div> 
    <div id="Exercise" class="content"> 
        <h3>Exercise</h3> 
        <p>Siamese cats are active and playful. They need mental and physical stimulation to stay happy. Providing them with interactive toys, cat trees, and puzzle feeders will keep them entertained. They enjoy playing with their owners, and some may even play fetch.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Health" class="content"> 
        <h3>Health</h3> 
        <p>Siamese cats are generally healthy, but they can be prone to certain genetic conditions, such as respiratory issues and dental problems. Regular vet checkups will ensure they remain healthy.</p>
