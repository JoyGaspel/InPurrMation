        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>The Asian semi-longhair cat is also referred to as the Tiffanie or Tiffany cat. This is a relatively new breed, developed in the 1980s.</p>
        <p>A fortunate accident produced a stunning new cat with a silky, soft coat in medium length. Not only are these cats stunningly beautiful, but they are friendly, curious, and playful. Much like the Asian cats they were developed from, these kitties have a tendency to vocalize loudly and make their opinions known. They are loving and devoted to their families and they are known to display jealousy toward other pets who get in the way or demand affection.</p>
        <p>Asian semi-longhair cats are curious and playful. They are not above swiping small items that catch their eye, so pet parents need to keep a close eye on valuable personal items!</p>

    <div id="Nutrition" class="content"> 
        <h3>Nutrition</h3> 
        <p>Asian semi-longhair cats have no special dietary requirements. Diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids, however, encourage soft, shiny coats. When selecting a high-quality diet for your cat, ensure that this nutrient is present.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Grooming" class="content"> 
        <h3>Grooming</h3> 
        <p>Since these kittens lack thick undercoats, they are less susceptible to matting compared to other medium to long haired cat breeds. Nevertheless, they still need regular brushing. Brushing your cat a few times a week will remove any loose hairs that could end up in your cat's digestive system later and cause hairballs.</p> 
        <p>Also, brushing your cat is another way to bond. As Asian semi-longhairs enjoy being pampered, they will greatly enjoy regular grooming sessions. Think about brushing your cat's teeth, and think about spoiling them with regular nail trims.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Exercise" class="content"> 
        <h3>Exercise</h3> 
        <p>Asian semi-longhair cats appear to be soft and fluffy, but this does not mean that they spend their days lounging about. In reality, these cats have a very playful nature! Running, climbing, jumping, and pouncing keep their muscles strong and healthy and encourage overall health.</p> 
        <p>Don't forget to provide your cat with a basket full of toys, scratching posts, and a cat tower. Asian semi-longhair cats appear to appreciate looking out windows slightly more than most other breeds, so a window seat could be a nice addition as well ‚Äì maybe with a birdfeeder outside!</p> 
        <p>As you probably anticipated, Asian semi-longhair cats love interactive play. The Asian semi-longhair cat is easy to train and can master such games as fetch.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Health" class="content"> 
        <h3>Health</h3> 
        <p>Just like hybrids in general, the Asian semi-longhair cat enjoys good health. There are no health problems associated with this breed, and they have an average life expectancy of around 15 years.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The initial Asian semi-longhair cats were a result of an accidental cross between the Burmese and the chinchilla Persian. The Burmilla breed of cat originates from the same cross, but it has a silver shaded shorthair coat.</p>
            <p>The Asian Group Cat Society was established in 1985 to promote the Asian semi-longhair cat and other similar breeds. Although these cats are beautiful, very friendly, and agreeable in all respects, the breed has been slow to gain popularity. England's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy granted its official recognition in 2003. To date, the breed is not recognized by United States registries.</p>

            <p>The head of the Asian semi-longhair is wedge-shaped with tapering cheekbones that come to a blunt muzzle. The brow curves smoothly to meet the bridge of the nose. A delicate nose break is to be found, and the nose tip must be in alignment with the chin.</p><br>
            <h2>EYES</h2><br>
            <p>Round, big, shining eyes that slant slightly toward the nose add to this cat's beauty. The eyes peer into any color, and are typically edged with thin, dark lines.</p><br>
            <h2>EARS</h2><br>
            <p>Ears must be medium to large, with broad bases and slight tip rounding. A gentle tilt forward is present in the profile, and furnishings like tufts or streamers are desirable.</p><br>
            <h2>LEGS & PAWS</h2><br>
            <p>Asian semi-longhair cats possess slender legs, with the front legs slightly shorter than the hind legs. The paws are neat oval shape and aren't too broad.</p><br>
            <h2>TAIL</h2><br>
            <p>The tail must be of medium to long length with long, plumed hair.</p><br>
            <h2>COAT</h2><br>
            <p>The semi-longhair cat of Asian origin has a silky, fine coat with no dense, cottony undercoat. The coat is of medium length, with an extremely soft texture.</p><br>
            <h2>COLOR</h2><br>
            <p>Asian semi-longhair cat colors and patterns are diverse, but the blue, brown, black, chocolate, and lilac are most striking. Color of the nose leather and paw pad must harmonize with the coat.</p><br>
