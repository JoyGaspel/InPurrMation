            <p>The Chantilly cat breed originated in the United States in the late 1960s. The breed was started with a pair of chocolate-colored cats of unknown origin. The Chantilly breed never gained widespread popularity and has always been rare. The breed was considered near extinction in the late 1980s and again in the late 2000s. Since 2015, the breed has been considered extinct with the passing of the last known Chantilly cat.</p><br>
