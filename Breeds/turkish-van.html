        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>

        <h3>Nutrition</h3>
        <p>As with most active breeds, Turkish Vans benefit from a high-protein diet to fuel their energy. Fresh, high-quality food with real meat as the first ingredient is essential to keep them healthy.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content">
        <h3>Grooming</h3>
        <p>Although Turkish Vans have long, luxurious coats, they have a water-resistant quality and shed very little. They do require grooming to keep their coat tangle-free, typically once or twice a week. Regular nail trimming and dental care should also be a part of their grooming routine.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Exercise" class="content">
        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>Turkish Vans are highly energetic and love to play, often engaging in running, climbing, and even swimming. They need plenty of space and activity to stay happy, so providing them with cat trees, tunnels, and toys will help keep them active.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Health" class="content">
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>Turkish Vans are generally healthy, but they can be prone to kidney disease. Regular vet visits are important to ensure their long-term health.
