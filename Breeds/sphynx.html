    <div id="Nutrition" class="content">
        <p>Sphynx cats have higher energy needs than other breeds due to their lack of a coat. A high-protein diet is important to keep them healthy. Choose a food with real meat or fish as the main ingredient and ensure they have a balanced diet.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content">
        <p>Despite having no fur, Sphynx cats require regular grooming. Their skin tends to accumulate oils, so they should be bathed every 1-2 weeks to keep them clean. They also need regular nail trimming and dental care.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Exercise" class="content">
        <p>Sphynx cats are highly energetic and love to play. They need a variety of toys and activities to keep them mentally and physically stimulated. They enjoy climbing and jumping, so providing vertical spaces will keep them happy.

    </div>
    <div id="Health" class="content">
        <p>Sphynx cats are generally healthy but are prone to certain conditions, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and skin conditions. Regular vet visits are essential for monitoring their health.
