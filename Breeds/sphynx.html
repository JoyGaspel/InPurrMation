        <h3>Nutrition</h3>
        <p>Sphynx cats have higher energy needs than other breeds due to their lack of a coat. A high-protein diet is important to keep them healthy. Choose a food with real meat or fish as the main ingredient and ensure they have a balanced diet.

    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content">
        <h3>Grooming</h3>

    <div id="Exercise" class="content">
        <h3>Exercise</h3>

    <div id="Health" class="content">
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>Sphynx cats are generally healthy but are prone to certain conditions, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and skin conditions. Regular vet visits are essential for monitoring their health.
