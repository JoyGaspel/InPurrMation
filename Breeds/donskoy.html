            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The Donskoy cat breed originated in Russia, specifically from Rostov-on-Don, hence the name. The breed appeared in 1987 when a kitten with a genetic mutation causing hairlessness was discovered by Elena Kovaleva. Although sometimes called the Don Sphynx, the Donskoy is not related to the better-known Sphynx cat (Canadian Hairless), whose hairlessness is caused by a recessive mutation in the keratin 71 gene.</p>
