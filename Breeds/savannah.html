        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>Savannah cats receive their unusual look from the serval, a small African wildcat with beautiful markings, long legs, and big ears. The domestic cat brings all of the lovely personality features that make domestic cats such appealing companions.</p>
        <p>If there is one thing you should know about Savannah cats, it is that they have an incredible amount of energy, even when they are several generations old. They enjoy snuggling, but they also have a great play drive and are extremely bright. This means a lot of cat proofing is needed. Without it, your Savannah cat would joyfully investigate every closet and drawer in your home, most likely removing various items for a thorough inspection.</p>
        <p>Most cats would go to great lengths to avoid water, but Savannahs are the exact opposite. An aquarium rapidly becomes a sought-after fishing site, a koi pond provides an opportunity for swimming (and fishing), and your faucets become popular playthings. These cats quickly learn how things work and, if given the opportunity, will jump up onto countertops to activate a jet of water for splashing. Open toilets are also fair game.</p>

    <div id="Nutrition" class="content">
        <p>The closer your Savannah cat is to a serval relative, the wilder their diet must be. Breeders frequently advocate raw diets with correct feline nutrition for these cats, which genuinely enjoy fresh food. Of course, you can offer both a high-quality dry or dehydrated food and a high-quality wet food. If you pick commercial food for your Savannah cat, be sure it is strong in protein and low in carbs.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content">
        <p>Savannah cats do an excellent job of keeping their short coats in peak condition, so weekly brushing is typically sufficient. Grooming strengthens your bond with your cat and is an excellent way to remove unwanted hair before it gets on your furnishings. Grooming shorthaired cats also helps to reduce hairballs.</p>
        <p>Savannahs are huge, active cats, so it's a good idea to train them to tolerate nail trims at an early age. These cats' claws lack sharp points, making them significantly less likely to accidentally damage your items or scratch you.</p>
        <p>Periodontal disease is a common condition among cats. Teach your cat to accept daily dental brushing using a specially shaped brush and pet-safe toothpaste. This will help extend the time between professional cleanings.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Exercise" class="content">
        <p>Savannah cats can develop destructive habits if they are bored, so companionship, safe toys, and lots of space are really necessary. Teach your cat to walk on a leash and harness, if possible. Regular walks provide plenty of mental and physical activity while also giving these affable cats additional opportunities to mingle.</p>
        <p>Give your Savannah cat the biggest, best cat tree you can find, and consider making them a catio or other safe outdoor/semi-outdoor habitat where they can spread out and exhibit their wild side. Window chairs are popular, as are sturdy scratching posts, puzzle games, and tough cat toys.</p>
        <p>Savannah cats are rough on their toys, so avoid anything that is easily broken or chewed apart. Check your cat's toys on a regular basis to make sure there are no broken or damaged parts that could be accidentally swallowed.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Health" class="content">
        <p>Savannah cats are generally healthy, however they are susceptible to two inheritable diseases: progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and pyruvate kinase deficiency. Responsible Savannah cat breeders attempt to avoid generating kittens with these disorders by genetically testing their breeding adult cats.</p>
        <p>Savannahs have a slightly higher chance of developing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) than cats with a purely domestic background. Furthermore, most male Savannah cats remain sterile until they are six generations removed from their full serval progenitor. This is just something to be aware of. It is not a problem for the cat, nor is it a problem for those looking for a pet Savannah.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The first Savannah cat was the product of an unintentional cross between Judee Frank's Siamese queen and a male serval he was keeping an eye on for another breeder. The kitten, born in 1986, was named Miracle but was quickly renamed "Savannah."</p>
            <p>Savannah had a litter of Turkish Angora kittens in 1989. She gave birth to three F2 kittens, two of which survived and one died. Savannah then changed hands and found herself with a breeder named Lori Buchko. Patrick Kelley purchased two of Savannah's babies from later breedings after seeing images of her in a 1986 Long Island Ocelot Club bulletin.</p>
            <p>Kelley formed a partnership with Joyce Scroufe, an exotic cat breeder who was first skeptical of the Savannah cat notion. However, word of the new hybrid spread quickly, and in 1996, a small group of breeders, including Kelley and Scroufe, created and presented the Savannah cat breed standard to The International Cat Association (TICA).</p>

        <h1>Did You Know?</h1>
        <p>Savannah cats hold the Guinness World Record for tallest domestic cat, with one F1 Savannah measuring 19.05 inches at the shoulder.</p>
        <p>The price of a Savannah cat depends on its generation - F1 (first generation) cats can cost $20,000+, while later generations are more affordable.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>BODY</h2><br>
            <p>Savannah cats have a long, slender appearance, and males are usually larger than females. In general, Savannahs resemble servals, with later generations displaying more domestic features.</p><br>
            <h2>HEAD</h2><br>
            <p>The head is small in comparison to the body, and the face forms an equilateral triangle. The snout protrudes slightly, while the muzzle is tapering with no break. When viewed in profile, the forehead appears straight to slightly convex, and it also forms a triangle that stretches from the top of the eye to the tip of the nose, then to the jawline, and finally back to the eye. The neck is long and slender.</p><br>
            <h2>EYES</h2><br>
            <p>The eyes are medium-sized and lie beneath slightly hooded brows. The bottom section of the eye is almond shaped, while the upper corner of the eye marks the start of a visual line that slopes toward the nose. Eyes are spaced at least one eye width apart. Any eye color is permissible.</p><br>
            <h2>EARS</h2><br>
            <p>A Savannah cat's ears are large, with deep bases and rounded peaks. The ears are located high on the head. Ear furnishings may exist, and ocelli markings are particularly desirable.</p><br>
            <h2>LEGS & PAWS</h2><br>
            <p>The legs are longer than average and have an athletic aspect; neither heavy musculature nor excessive delicacy are present. The hind legs are slightly longer than the forelegs, and the paws are medium-size ovals.</p><br>
            <h2>TAIL</h2><br>
            <p>The Savannah cat's tail is medium to thick and medium in length, stopping between the bottom of the hock and the ground. The tail tapers somewhat and ends bluntly.</p><br>
            <h2>COAT</h2><br>
            <p>The coat is short to medium length, with slightly coarse guard hairs and softer undercoat. Savannah cats' markings feel softer than guard hairs.</p><br>
            <h2>COLOR</h2><br>
            <p>Several hues are acceptable, including black, brown spotted tabby, black silver spotted tabby, and black smoke. The markings are clear, and the tear duct lines are apparent. Black Savannahs have black nose leather, but spotted Savannah cats can have black noses, pink to brick noses with black liners, or black nose leather with pink to brick center stripes. All color combinations have deep charcoal or brownish-black paw pads.</p><br>

    <section class="Trivia">
        <h1>Did You Know?</h1>
        <p>Savannah cats can jump up to 8 feet high from a standing position due to their long legs inherited from their serval ancestors.</p>
        <p>The F1 through F4 generations of Savannah cats are considered "foundation" generations and are typically larger and more wild in appearance than later generations.</p>
