        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>The Javanese cat, also known as the Colorpoint Longhair, is lovingly called the "Javi." Like the Siamese cats that form the breed's foundation, this cat is gregarious, playful, and talkative, frequently meowing and chatting for reasons that their human companions may not comprehend. All things considered, Javanese cats make excellent family pets. They are a lot of pleasure to be around because they get along well with other people, including other cats and well-behaved dogs.</p>
        <p>The Javanese cat is incredibly athletic and enjoys interactive games, high jumps, and quick loops around the house. Any rodents that come into contact with these cats are unlikely to live for very long because they are also skilled micers.</p>
        <p>In their quest for fun and entertainment, Javanese cats have a tendency to poke their noses into everything, quickly learning how to open cupboards and drawers. Like many other social cat breeds that thrive on human interaction, Javanese cats can become depressed if their favorite people spend more time away than they do at home. For this reason, these cats are best for families that define themselves as homebodies.</p>

    <div id="Nutrition" class="content"> 
        <h3>Nutrition</h3> 
        <p>The Javanese cat has no unique nutritional requirements, however it is advisable to feed a high-quality, high-protein diet with real meat or fish as the principal ingredient. Like many other Oriental cat breeds, Javanese can live a long life. Feeding a cuisine that is suited for your life stage will help you stay healthy throughout time.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Grooming" class="content"> 
        <h3>Grooming</h3> 
        <p>The Javanese cat has a silky, long coat that does not mat due to the lack of an undercoat. Brushing once or twice a week can help this cat preserve its wonderful appearance.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Exercise" class="content"> 
        <h3>Exercise</h3> 
        <p>As natural athletes, Javanese cats don't need much encouragement to play. Simply set them up for success, and they will most likely do the rest - possibly with some assistance from you. These cats enjoy playing fetch, using feathery wands, and chasing laser beams.</p> 
        <p>When you can't join in the fun, they'll keep themselves busy by climbing their cat tree, watching birds from the ledge, jumping up onto the tallest shelves they can discover, and, of course, playing with toys from their own treasure trove.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Health" class="content"> 
        <h3>Health</h3> 
        <p>Javanese cats are generally healthy with no known breed-specific genetic diseases. Like all cats, they benefit from regular veterinary check-ups to maintain their health and wellbeing.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>You could believe that the Javanese cat is from the island of Java, but the truth is a little less exciting. While this breed takes its name from that wonderful Pacific island, its origins are domestic in nature, and there is no mystery surrounding its family history.</p>
            <p>The Javanese cat is a color variation of the Balinese cat, which is a long-haired Siamese. Javanese cat breeders selectively breed kittens with red, tortoiseshell, lynx, and cream points.</p>
            <p>The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) is the only breed registry that distinguishes between Balinese and Javanese cats. This gorgeous breed received formal recognition in 1987.</p>

            <h2>COAT</h2><br>
            <p>The coat is medium-length, with a single layer of silky fur. The Javanese cat's coat is unique in that it lies close to the body while growing a distinguishing plume on the tail.</p><br>
            <h2>COLOR</h2><br>
            <p>CFA defines 24 distinct Javanese cat colors in addition to the four recognized Balinese colors. The nose leather and paw pad colors should complement the coat color.</p><br>

        <div class="content-text">
            <h2>BODY</h2><br>
            <p>The body is slim, muscular, and athletic, with an elegant and sophisticated appearance.</p><br>
            <h2>HEAD</h2><br>
            <p>The head should have a long, tapered wedge. It should be medium-sized and in appropriate proportion to the body. The wedge shape should continue from the nose to the points of the ears, forming a triangle with no breaks at the whiskers. Male cats may show some jowls.</p><br>
            <h2>EYES</h2><br>
            <p>The eyes should be almond-shaped and medium-sized. They should slant toward the nose, forming harmonious lines with the ears and the wedge shape of the head.</p><br>
            <h2>EARS</h2><br>
            <p>The Javanese cat's ears should be quite broad, with wide bases and sharp points.</p><br>
            <h2>LEGS & PAWS</h2><br>
            <p>The legs should be long and slender, with the back legs slightly longer than the front. The paws should be small and elegant ovals.</p><br>
            <h2>TAIL</h2><br>
            <p>The Javanese cat's tail should be long and thin, tapering to a sharp point. It should have attractive plumage.</p><br>
