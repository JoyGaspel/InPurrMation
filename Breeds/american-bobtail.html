        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>The American Bobtail cat is known for its friendly, doglike nature and wild appearance. Despite their feral lineage, they are domesticated and boast large vocabularies filled with various sounds. American Bobtails form strong bonds with their human families and get along well with other pets. They are energetic, enjoy jumping and climbing, and can be trained to walk on leashes or play fetch. However, they are also skilled escape artists, so it‚Äôs important to ensure their carriers are securely latched when traveling.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The American Bobtail cat is a new breed that developed in the 1960s. Breeders created it using a feral brown tabby male with a short tail and a seal point domestic female. This breed formed through natural selection, primarily with feral domestic cats that had natural bobtails. Different breeders across the United States worked together to develop the American Bobtail, leading to a strong breed with no known genetic defects. The gene for the American Bobtail's short tail is dominant, unlike the Japanese Bobtail, which has a recessive gene for its short tail. The International Cat Association (TICA) recognized the American Bobtail in 1989. It also participates in championships with the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) and is recognized by the Cat Aficionado Association of China. The World Cat Federation acknowledges the breed but does not allow it to compete.</p>
