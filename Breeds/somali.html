    <div id="Nutrition" class="content">
        <p>Somali cats require a high-quality, protein-rich diet to fuel their active lifestyles. Look for commercial food with real meat as the first ingredient to ensure they stay healthy and energetic.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content">
        <p>Their semi-long coat requires regular grooming. Brushing 2-3 times a week will help to prevent matting and tangling, as well as reduce shedding. Keep their nails trimmed and their teeth cleaned as part of their regular care.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Exercise" class="content">
        <p>Somali cats are very active and playful. They require plenty of exercise to stay fit and healthy. Interactive toys, climbing structures, and puzzle feeders will help to keep them engaged and entertained.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Health" class="content">
        <p>Somali cats are generally healthy but may be prone to certain conditions such as progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and hip dysplasia. Regular veterinary visits are important to monitor their health.

            <p>The Somali cat is a variation of the Abyssinian and is thought to have originated from the same gene pool. The breed was recognized in the 1960s, and over time, breeders worked to develop the distinct long-haired version we now know as the Somali.</p>
