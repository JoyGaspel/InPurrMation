        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>Underneath the rugged look of the American Wirehair cat is a sweet disposition and a soft heart. These friendly cats are durable and adaptable, with a special appearance that their owners adore. While American Wirehairs are technically a short haired breed, the texture of their hairs makes them appear medium-haired. Their coat will have some straight hairs, but the majority have a crimped texture with hooked tips, which provides it with a springy sensation. They shed moderately like other shorthaired cats. American Wirehair cats have many colors and patterns. They are bred with American Shorthairs to produce genetic diversity.</p>

        <h3>Nutrition</h3>
        <p>As with all cats, American Wirehairs are obligate carnivores and require a diet rich in meat to survive. We suggest you feed them a good quality cat food that includes lots of omega-3 fatty acids to maintain a healthy coat.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content">
        <h3>Grooming</h3>
        <p>Groom your American Wirehair cat with extra care since their coat hairs are brittle and break easily. Brush your cat only when required, like in the spring shedding season to ease out excess hair. Similar to other cats, good dental health and regular nail trimming benefit the American Wirehair.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Exercise" class="content">
        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>The American Wirehair cat is quite athletic but not overly hyperactive. They love to run, jump, and climb when they are not on the couch with their families. Highly social, they adore interactive play. Though they like to pounce on catnip mice and independent toys, they love it when their families participate in games. Chasing a laser pointer or playing with wand toys fulfills their prey-catching instinct. To save your furniture and drapes, give your cat a tall tower that comes with a built-in scratching post.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Health" class="content">
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>American Wirehair cats are generally healthy and have no known genetic issues.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The American Wirehair breed came about from one male kitten born in upstate New York in 1966 to a couple of short haired barn cats. A breeder, Joan O'Shea, bought the unusual kitten for $50 and named him Counsel Rock Adam of Hi-Fi. She mated him with American Shorthair females, one of which was another cat that was suspected to harbor the wire hair gene. This original red tabby and white cat passed on his DNA through subsequent generations, giving rise to a new breed. The American Wirehair was officially recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association in 1978 as a variety of American Shorthair. The breed is also recognized by the World Cat Federation, the American Cat Fanciers Association, and the Canadian Cat Association.</p>

            <h2>EYES</h2><br>
            <p>The eyes in American Wirehair cats can be any color that contrasts with their coat. The eyes must be wide set, large, and rounded in shape.</p><br>
            <h2>EARS</h2><br>
            <p>The ears of American Wirehair cats are medium, wide set, and tipped slightly.</p><br>
            <h2>LEGS & PAWS</h2><br>
