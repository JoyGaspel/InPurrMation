        <h3>Nutrition</h3> 
        <p>British Shorthairs do not have specific dietary requirements, but it is important to provide them with a balanced diet to maintain their overall health.

    </div> 
    <div id="Grooming" class="content"> 
        <h3>Grooming</h3> 
        <p>The British Shorthair's dense, plush coat requires regular grooming to keep it in good condition. Weekly brushing is usually sufficient to remove loose hairs and minimize shedding. During the shedding season, more frequent brushing may be necessary.
        </p> 
        <p>It is also important to maintain regular dental care by brushing their teeth and providing dental treats or toys. Regular nail trimming and ear cleaning should be part of their grooming routine.

    </div> 
    <div id="Exercise" class="content"> 
        <h3>Exercise</h3> 
        <p>British Shorthairs are not overly active cats, but they do enjoy playtime and interactive toys. Providing them with scratching posts, climbing trees, and puzzle toys can help keep them mentally and physically stimulated. Encouraging play sessions can also help prevent obesity.

    </div> 
    <div id="Health" class="content"> 
        <h3>Health</h3> 
        <p>The British Shorthair is generally a healthy breed, but they can be prone to certain genetic conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Regular veterinary check-ups and genetic testing can help identify and manage these conditions.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The British Shorthair is one of the oldest cat breeds, with a history that dates back to the Roman era. These cats were originally brought to Britain by the Romans and were prized for their hunting skills and robust constitution. Over time, they interbred with native cats and developed into the breed known today.</p>
            <p>In the late 19th century, British Shorthairs were formally recognized and exhibited in cat shows. The breed's popularity declined during the two World Wars, but dedicated breeders worked to revive it. Today, the British Shorthair is one of the most popular and beloved cat breeds worldwide.</p><br>
