            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The Egyptian Mau cat is one of the oldest known cat breeds, dating back at least 3,000 years. The word "Mau" meant cat or sun in Ancient Egypt. Papyri and frescoes dating back as far as 1550 B.C. depict spotted cats that resemble today's Egyptian Maus. For many years, cats believed to be descended from the felines of ancient Egypt were kept as pets by members of the country's nobility and diplomatic corps. The breed is known for its distinctive appearance, with a coat pattern that features spots on the tips of the hairs.</p><br>
