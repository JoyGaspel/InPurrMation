        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>The Australian Mist has the distinction of being the first pedigreed cat ever developed in Australia.</p>
        <p>This beautiful shorthair was first developed by breeding the Abyssinian with the Burmese. The Abyssinian added the playful personality and ticked coat of the breed. The Burmese added its calm temperament and smoothly shaded coloring. Some foundation cats also contained domestic shorthairs, who added a broad amount of genetics which resulted in the development of a healthy cat breed that shows an exquisite diversity of colors.</p>
        <p>Australian Mist cats possess beautiful short coats in marbled or spotted tabby patterns. Ticked coats make these cats look soft and shaded, which has given rise to the use of the word "mist" in the breed name.</p>
        <p>As a loving, easy-going cat, it is little wonder that the Australian Mist is highly sought after in its home country, and the breed is increasing in popularity on show rings throughout the world.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The Australian Mist cat was developed in Australia during the 1970s by Dr. Truda Straede from Burmese, Abyssinians, and domestic short-haired cats. The distinctive coat colors and spotted patterns of the cat gave it its initial name: the Spotted Mist. As the breed continued to develop, marbled coat patterns appeared, and in 1998, the official name was changed to Australian Mist.</p>
            <p>Australian Mist cats are prevalent all over their native land, yet to date, have not yet been extensively acknowledged across Europe, the United Kingdom, and America. Not recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) at the current time, the Australian Mist is completely accepted by The International Cat Association (TICA).</p>
            <p>Its friendly disposition, overall good health, and striking appearance are spreading popularity outside Australia.</p>
