        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>Is the Himalayan a Persian cat? Is a Colorpoint Persian identical to a Himalayan? The answer depends on the breed association. Some registries consider the Himalayan‚Äîaffectionately known as the Himmie‚Äîto be a color variation of the Persian and others consider the Himalayan to be a distinct breed in its own right.</p>
        <p>Himalayans or Colorpoint Persian cats also have pointed markings and stunning blue eyes such as Siamese cats. Simultaneously, however, they also own long, silky coats similar to their Persian relatives. Furthermore, that Persian heritage also includes Himalayans usually having flat or brachycephalic faces that add to the distinctiveness of their appearance.</p>
        <p>Himalayan cats are generally extremely sweet natured and enjoy cuddling with their favorite humans. Due to their Siamese genes, Himalayan cats are a bit more playful than the typical Persian. If you want a cat that enjoys lounging around and are willing to spend your days grooming your cat, then the Himalayan could be your ideal feline friend.</p>

    <div id="Nutrition" class="content">
        <p>Himalayans require no special diet, but like any other cat, the Himalayan enjoys a superior diet that features real meat or fish listed first in the ingredients. You may want to seek out food that has added omega essential fatty acids to promote coat and skin health.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content">
        <p>Long, plush fur requires daily grooming sessions, which Himalayans usually love. Not only is daily brushing a mat-stopper, it's a great bonding ceremony. Some Himalayan cats need daily facial grooming to clean away tear staining. It's more prevalent in those with thinner faces and facial folds that collect moisture as it makes its way down from the tear ducts.</p>
        <p>Additional grooming rituals include regular nail trims and toothbrushing, along with ear cleaning. Some Himalayan cats are prone to oily skin and hair, making occasional baths necessary.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Exercise" class="content">
        <p>Since the Himalayan cats are likely to become obese, daily exercise should be greatly encouraged. Fortunately, the cats do love strenuous play and soon look forward to it when made into a routine. Similar to Siamese, Himalayan cats also like interactive play such as fetch and will happily pursue a laser pointer (just take care not to shine the laser in your cat's eyes).</p>
        <p>If your cat has a very short face, you may need to slow down and lessen the intensity of playtime to avoid shortness of breath.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Health" class="content">
        <p>Himalayan cats are a healthy breed overall, but some do have the gene for polycystic kidney disease. Responsible breeders screen for PKD, which significantly lowers the chances of producing disease-prone kittens.</p>
        <p>As Himalayan cats are brachycephalic, they have flat faces and are prone to brachycephalic airway syndrome, which makes it difficult for them to breathe. Some Himalayan cats also experience dental malocclusions, in addition to cherry eye, which appears in any breed with protruding eyes.</p>
        <p>There are some people who experience feline hyperesthesia syndrome (twitch-skin syndrome), a nervous disorder causing a variety of awkward symptoms.</p>
        <p>Another usual heart condition named hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) also occurs in Himalayan cats.</p>
        <p>None of these conditions are common and the majority of Himalayan breeders take care to mate only healthy parents with hopes of avoiding inheritable diseases afflicting offspring.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>In the 1930s, two researchers at Harvard, Dr. Clyde Keeler and Virginia Cobb, chose to do a study by crossing Siamese and Persian cats. They made Newton's Debutante through their efforts. They just referred to it as a Siamese‚ÄìPersian after its parents. This handsome cat possessed traditional Siamese colorpoint markings, blue eyes, and a silky, long coat. He eventually turned out to be one of the first representatives of the Himalayan (Colorpoint Persian) breed.</p>
            <p>Cat breeder and conservationist Jean Mill, as well as the creator of the Bengal cat breed, started breeding the cat in 1948.</p>
            <p>In 1955, Brian Sterling-Webb also developed a comparable crossbreed cat that he named the Long-Haired Colorpoint. Marguerita Goforth's persistent attempts at crossing Siamese and Persian cats in 1957 led to breed status with the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA). Goforth is also attributed with naming the Himalayan cat breed.</p>
