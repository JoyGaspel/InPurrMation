    <div id="Nutrition" class="content"> 
        <h3>Nutrition</h3> 
        <p>Himalayan cats have no special nutritional needs. It is important to provide a high-quality diet to support their well-being. Ensure that real meat or fish is the primary ingredient in their commercial diet.</p> 
    </div>
    <div id="Grooming" class="content"> 
        <h3>Grooming</h3> 
        <p>Himalayan cats have long, luxurious coats that require regular grooming to prevent matting and tangles. Brush your cat's coat daily with a fine-toothed comb to keep it looking its best. Regular grooming also helps reduce shedding and hairballs.</p> 
        <p>In addition to brushing, you should also clean your cat's ears, trim their nails, and brush their teeth regularly to maintain their overall health and hygiene.</p> 
    </div>
    <div id="Exercise" class="content"> 
        <h3>Exercise</h3> 
        <p>Himalayan cats are moderately active and enjoy playtime with their owners. Provide them with toys, scratching posts, and climbing structures to keep them entertained and engaged. Interactive play sessions with their favorite humans will help keep them physically and mentally stimulated.</p> 
        <p>While they enjoy playtime, Himalayans are also content to lounge and relax, making them suitable for both active and more laid-back households.</p> 
    </div>
    <div id="Health" class="content"> 
        <h3>Health</h3> 
        <p>Himalayan cats are generally healthy, but they can be prone to certain health issues due to their brachycephalic (short-nosed) structure. Common health concerns include respiratory problems, dental issues, and eye conditions such as excessive tearing.</p> 
        <p>Regular veterinary check-ups and a healthy diet can help prevent and manage these issues. Be sure to monitor your cat's health and seek veterinary care if you notice any signs of illness.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The Himalayan cat breed was developed in the United States in the early 20th century by crossing Persian and Siamese cats to create a breed with the Persian's long, luxurious coat and the Siamese's striking color points. The breed was officially recognized by cat registries in the 1950s and has since become a popular and beloved breed.</p>
            <p>Himalayan cats are known for their beautiful appearance and sweet temperament, making them a favorite among cat lovers worldwide. They are often referred to as "Himmies" by their affectionate owners.</p>
