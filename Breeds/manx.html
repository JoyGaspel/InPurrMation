        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>The Manx is one of just a few tailless cat breeds, although it is arguably the most well-known since it is more common than Kurilian Bobtail and Japanese Bobtail cats, which share some characteristics. Depending on locale and registry, these cats may have long or short hair in a range of colors; it's worth mentioning that certain purebred cat registries refer to long-haired Manx cats as Cymrics.</p>
        <p>The Manx cat breed standard demands show grade animals to be tailless or almost tailless, although pet quality Manx cats may have somewhat longer tails. There are several nicknames for Manx cats with varying tail lengths. "Rumpy" manx cats are entirely tailless, whereas "rumpy risers" have little stubs. "Stumpy" manx cats have partial tails, whereas a manx with a nearly full length tail is known as a "Longy."</p>
        <p>Members of the Manx family are sometimes compared to dogs because of their high play drive and inclination to form strong ties with both human and animal mates.</p>

    <div id="Nutrition" class="content"> 
        <h3>Nutrition</h3> 
        <p>Manx cats do not have any unique dietary requirements; however, it is advisable to provide a high-quality diet with real meat or fish as the main ingredient.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Grooming" class="content"> 
        <h3>Grooming</h3> 
        <p>Manx cats with short hair only need to be brushed once or twice a week to eliminate extra hair. If you have a long-haired Manx, brush them at least once a day to avoid mats in their fine undercoat.</p> 
        <p>Because the Manx is prone to jumping and climbing with considerable enthusiasm, you may want to keep their claws clipped short to provide some protection for your things.</p> 
        <p>One more thing: Manx cats, like other breeds, benefit from at-home dental treatment. Consider training your kitty to accept toothbrushing from an early age.</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Exercise" class="content"> 
        <h3>Exercise</h3> 
        <p>The Manx are known for their tremendous physical prowess, which includes running at high speeds, leaping to the highest possible heights, and climbing anything accessible. Tall cat towers, scratching posts, and a diverse selection of toys can boost your cat's play drive. Manx cats enjoy interactive play, so seek for toys that allow you to join in!</p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Health" class="content"> 
        <h3>Health</h3> 
        <p>Many Manx cats have excellent health, but the breed is prone to specific difficulties, including a congenital abnormality known as Manx syndrome. Manx syndrome is a spinal anomaly that affects the central nervous system, resulting in symptoms like constipation, incontinence, and hind leg paralysis.</p> 
        <p>The Manx has a higher than normal risk of Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease, which includes bladder stones.</p> 
        <p>Skeletal abnormalities can also occur, causing serious difficulties or just altering the cat's stride. If your cat has a deformity, they may eventually require assistance in controlling arthritis symptoms as they age.</p>

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The Manx cat originated on the Isle of Man, which is located in the Irish Sea. There, members of the breed were initially referred to as "stubbin" cats, a term that some locals still use.</p>
            <p>The Manx, like all domestic cats, is descended from the African wildcat (Felis lybica). The earliest domestic cats to arrive on the Isle of Man most likely had long tails, but at least one of them possessed the dominant gene that causes natural tailless mutation. The spontaneous mutation that causes Manx cats to be born without tails became more widespread on the Isle of Man as genetic diversity declined over time.</p>
            <p>When these one-of-a-kind cats first appeared in cat shows in the late 1800s, they piqued interest. The first Manx cat breed standard was published in 1903, and the breed was one of the first to be recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association. The Manx registry records date back to the 1920s.</p>

            <h2>COAT</h2><br>
            <p>The Manx cat's double coat is dense and luxurious. Shorthair Manx should have a shiny, hard outer coat, but longhaired Manx should have silky, medium-length coats with longer neck ruffs, breeches (hair on the backs of the hind legs), and belly fur.</p><br>
            <h2>COLOR</h2><br>
            <p>The Manx can be almost any color and pattern. The only colors that are not permitted for display are those that indicate hybridization: lavender, chocolate, pointed, or any of these colors blended with white. The color of the nose leather and paw pads should be complementary to the cat's coat color.</p><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="content-text">
            <h2>BODY</h2><br>
            <p>The body is round and robust, with plenty of muscle. The rump should be higher than the shoulders since the back legs are longer than the front legs. The back should be short, with a continuous arch running from rump to shoulders.</p><br>
            <h2>HEAD</h2><br>
            <p>The head should be round with strong cheekbones. When viewed in profile, the head should be medium length with a moderate dip from the forehead to the nose. The muzzle should be well-developed, with a prominent chin. Manx cats should have well-defined whisker pads and jowls, with males having more jowl than females.</p><br>
            <h2>EYES</h2><br>
            <p>The eyes are large, rounded, and somewhat tilted toward the ears.</p><br>
            <h2>EARS</h2><br>
            <p>The Manx cat has medium-sized ears that are widely separated and angled slightly outward, with wide bases that taper to rounded ends.</p><br>
            <h2>LEGS & PAWS</h2><br>
            <p>Legs should be strongly boned. The hind legs should have thick, muscular thighs but be straight when viewed from behind. The front legs should be shorter than the back legs. The paws should be rounded.</p><br>
            <h2>TAIL</h2><br>
            <p>While complete taillessness is ideal, Manx cats may have a rise of bone at the end of their spine.</p><br>
