        <h1>Personality and Temperament</h1><br>
        <p>The Selkirk Rex is often referred to as "The cat in sheep's clothing," owing to its luscious woolly coats along with a very special personality of its own. This breed is not for anyone who wishes for a conventional lap cat because it has an independent streak; however, to a large extent, this breed values human companionship and has a calm character.</p>
        <p>Playful and fun-loving, they sleep a lot; once they are out of their kitten stage, they find a bad reputation for staying out of trouble. At the same time, they show a wonderfully playful side and will cheerfully entertain you with their antics.</p>
        <p>Long cuddling sessions are a no-no for a Selkirk Rex cat; they hate it. But on the other hand, they do not enjoy being left alone for long periods of time. As long as they can stay within the company of someone, curled up with their humans while watching TV, or napping next to another cat, they spend their time lived.</p>

    <div id="Nutrition" class="content"> 
        <h3>Nutrition</h3> 
        <p>Selkirk Rex cannot demand specific nutritional needs, but an above-average intake of Omega Fatty Acids foods would help maintain healthy skin and coat condition. As cases of obesity are common with these cats, find high protein low carbohydrate diets.
        </p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Grooming" class="content"> 
        <h3>Grooming</h3> 
        <p>The skin coat marvelously of the Selkirk Rex cat: wholly unlike any other coat, it is to be half wavy and half soft yet thick. This special coat, indeed, requires a bit of attention, but not to make it an annoyance. Separate tangles, and comb to avoid painful mats; too much brushing or combing could cause the fur to appear wavy rather than crisping up the curls.</p>
        <p>Brush their teeth and think about nail trimming. Such routine maintenance could actually improve a cat's breath and prevent periodontal disease, while infrequent trims might save your furniture, skin, and clothes from injury.</p>
        <p>Some ‚Äì but not all ‚Äì Selkirk Rex cats do indeed produce excessive body oil and would need a bath every now and then. If your cat is one of the few who need the bath every now and then, rest assured to use gentle cat shampoo and slow-air dry it; any sort of hairdryer will burn the cat's sensitive skin or make the hair all puffed up, giving it a poodle-like appearance.
        </p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Exercise" class="content"> 
        <h3>Exercise</h3> 
        <p>Selkirk Rex cats actively participate in field sports if given a chance to play with a human companion, a feline friend, or a human-feline interaction. For cats, they love heights. Tall towers with maybe a window seat for surveying the outside world would be definitely welcome. Puzzle toys like scratching posts that pique their fancies, empty boxes, and crinkly paper bags, will bring joys to them.</p>
        <p>They won't need to be encouraged to play in the younger years, but as they age, the encouragement may be needed because of becoming more prone to obesity.
        </p> 
    </div> 
    <div id="Health" class="content"> 
        <h3>Health</h3> 
        <p>The Selkirk Rex cats are generally healthy. So far, there has been no known genetic problem associated with this breed. A few breeders may be testing the cats for possible polycystic kidney disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>The Selkirk Rex breed started history with the 1987 birth of a kitten in Montana. This curly-haired kitten's mother was a rescue of unknown breed, and the kitten found its way into the care of a cat breeder named Jeri Newman, who named the cat Miss DePesto, after a character played by actress Allyce Beasley.</p><br>
            <p>Once Miss DePesto turned into an adult, she was bred onto a black Persian male, PhotoFinish of Deekay. Of her litter of six kittens, three had straight coats, and three had curly coats, proving that the curly coat is inherited by an autosomal dominant gene.</p>
            <p>After it was well established, the breed was named after Newman's stepfather, Selkirk. In time, breeders began to cross them with American Shorthairs, Himalayans, Persians, British Shorthairs, and exotic Shorthairs. Presently, only The International Cat Association (TICA) accepts the American Shorthair as an outcross breed.</p>

            </p><br>
            <h2>COLOR</h2><br>
            <p>Selkirk Rex cats may exhibit any genetically possible coat color and pattern. Nose leather and paw pad color should correspond with coat color.

            </p><br>
            <h2>EYES</h2><br>
            <p>The Selkirk Rex should have large, rounded eyes that are set wide apart. The outer corner of the eye should be set slightly higher than the inner corner.

            <h2>EARS</h2><br>
            <p>The ears should be of medium size with broad bases. Furnishings should be curly.
